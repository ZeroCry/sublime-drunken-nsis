# Drunken NSIS for Sublime Text

## Description

This might or might not be a good idea to improve your NSIS skills. Using this package, you will likely never memorize the syntax. But then again, using this you don't have to anymore. This package irons some of the inconsistencies of the NSIS language, allowing command aliases to be completed into valid syntax. Furthermore, valid syntax completions are included as well.

## Aliases

### Prince Versions

Named after the Prince Emulator in Douglas Coupland's [Microserfs](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/microserfs.html), these versions make no difference between **`BringToFront`**/`Bring2Front` or **`Goto`**/`Go2`.

### Word Order

The order of noun and verb is reversible, you can use combos such as **`FileRead`**/`ReadFile` or **`SectionSetText`**/`SetSectionText`
