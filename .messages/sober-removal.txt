As of this version, Drunken NSIS no longer ships with “sober” completions and
is intended as an extension of seperate NSIS packages for Sublime Text. You
can install any of the following via Package Control.

    “NSIS Completions & Snippets” (recommended)
    https://github.com/idleberg/NSIS-Sublime-Text

    “NSIS Plug-in Completions”, completions for third-party plug-ins
    https://github.com/idleberg/NSIS-Sublime-Text-Addons

    “NSIS”, a syntax highlighter
    https://github.com/SublimeText/NSIS

Sorry for the inconvenience!
